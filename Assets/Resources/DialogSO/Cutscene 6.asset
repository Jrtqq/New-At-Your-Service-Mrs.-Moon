  - Never seen our shelter so... alive. Everyone is preparing for a siege.
  - "It\u2019s now or never. All shards, except the last one, are broken. We are
    in the reach of hand from bringing the Endless day and human\u2019s tiranny down."
  - "And you\u2019ll celebrate victory under my glorious light... Isn\u2019t it beautiful?"
  - We will do this.
