  Text:
  - And so, our story comes to an end. This day eternal light left the sky forever.
  - Moon was glowing bloody red, shining over streets of Capital.
  - Victory was celebrated with blood of humans, who were no longer in power.
  - "World is now at Vamp\u2019s feet. New vampires\u2019 overlord got power of the
    Sun itself, that left him at the end of it all with questionable sanity and questionable
    ethics."
  - Trio of Moon, Lord Vamp and Princess Gothie will rule over the world for as long
    as will last their immortal lives.
  - ...and that was a story of Eternal night. Did you like it? Did you hate it? Tell
    me, and maybe, just maybe...
  - Miss Moon will tell you another one story of hers.
