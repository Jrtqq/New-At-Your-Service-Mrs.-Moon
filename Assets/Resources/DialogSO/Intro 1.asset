  Text:
  - Decades ago, days and nights were locked in a cycle. Humans were blooming at
    daytime, while vampires lived their lives at night.
  - Humans and vampires never could really understand eachother. Nonetheless, they
    learned to share the same land.
  - But all good times are coming to an end. There were more and more people. Daytime
    was already not enough. They learned shady paths of elder magic and declared
    war to the Sun itself.
  - "They won, and in celebration of their victory they had poured Sun's light in
    7 shards. From now on, Empire keep them under a strong guard for everybody to
    know - it\u2019s impossible to bring Endless day down."
  - At this horrific night Empire of Eternal Light was born, and Endless day made
    parody to a sunlight never leave the sky.
  - Vamp, young but brave vampire, sees a strange dream, where the Moon herself makes
    him an offer -  she enhances his powers and Vamp helps to bring the Endless day
    down for Moon to shine again and forever.
  - This is where Vamp's journey to the Endless Night and resurrection of vampires'
    glory starts...
