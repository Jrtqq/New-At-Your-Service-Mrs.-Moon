  Text:
  - I'm still alive. I'm still drinking blood. That's a big luck, if we take into
    account what dangers I've experienced for last days.
  - This horrid place still looks trash in comparison to what vampires deserve.
  - But now we can breath freely, at least. Positive changes are coming, let the
    Moon bless us!
  - Hm, you called me?
  - Nevermind.
  - I shall admit, you did a good job. I almost forgot how... Pleasing it is to shine
    so bright.
