  Text:
  - Help us, void of cosmos...
  - Teethy boy, you've made a huge mistake with that... girl you're constantly blabbing
    about.
  - You told here too much and someone have heard you two!
  - These human bastards have put a barrier on me! I can't help you tonight as much
    as I always do.
  - Gladly, at least we have some good news.
  - You must break the shard, but you're not required to kill everybody. Just ones
    you're able to reach.
  - Take it as a sorry gift from me.
  - They are prepared for your visit, be cautious.
